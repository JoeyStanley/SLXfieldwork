# Notes

What do we want this Shiny app to look like?

## Main functions

Given that someone has their data processed with DARLA, what do we want them to do?

* The data would be processed under-the-hood once loaded, using my Order of Operations.

* A simple vowel plot of midpoints. 
  * It would have some customizable functions. Nothing crazy like with the GSV, but at least a few tweaks here and there. We'll see how easy some features are to implement. 
  * I would control some aspects of the plot, such as Wells Lexical Sets and colors. 

* A vowel plot of certain allophones.
  * BAT-BAN split.
  * All prelaterals
  
* A trajectory plot.

* Simple calculations like the LBMS.
